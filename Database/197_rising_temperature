Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.
+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+

For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:
+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# SELECT w1.Id AS Id
# FROM Weather w1
# JOIN Weather w2
# ON DATEDIFF(w1.RecordDate, w2.RecordDate) = 1
# AND w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;


SELECT w1.Id AS Id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON TO_DAYS(w1.RecordDate) = TO_DAYS(w2.RecordDate) + 1
AND w1.Temperature > w2.Temperature;
